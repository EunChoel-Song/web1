	<p> Market cap—or market capitalization—refers to the total value of all a
	company's shares of stock. It is calculated by multiplying the price of a stock
	by its total number of outstanding shares. For example, a company with 20 million 
    shares selling at $50 a share would have a market cap of $1 billion.</P>
